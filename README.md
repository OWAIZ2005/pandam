# PANDAM

PANDAM is a direct **barter marketplace**: users list what they _have_, state
what they _need_, search listings, get rule-based matches, send barter offers,
chat, complete the exchange, and review each other. No money, no credits, no
wallet — a good is traded directly for a good.

> **Status: full V1 marketplace loop.** Built: the monorepo and build tooling;
> the full domain/database foundation; session auth plus Google/Apple sign-in;
> a one-time demo identity-verification onboarding step; the `@pandam/ui`
> design system and app navigation shell; I HAVE / I NEED, discovery, matches,
> and profile on real API data with real R2 image upload; the full
> request → offer → chat loop (an offer opens its conversation the moment
> it's sent, not only on accept) with accept/decline, barter transactions,
> reviews, notifications, and abuse reports/disputes; real-money purchase of a
> `sale`/`both` listing via Razorpay. **Not** built: disputes/admin
> resolution UI, and the permanent V1 exclusions (AI matching, credits,
> currency beyond the optional Razorpay purchase path). See
> [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md).

> This README describes what's on the current working branch; `docs/` may
> lag behind it in places (age of the codebase moves faster than the docs).

## Prerequisites

- Node `^20.19.4 || ^22.13.0 || >=24.3.0` (see `.nvmrc`; required by React Native 0.86 / Expo SDK 57)
- pnpm `>= 9` (`npm i -g pnpm` or `corepack enable`)
- For native builds only: Xcode / Android Studio, plus an Expo account for EAS

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/worker/.dev.vars.example apps/worker/.dev.vars
```

## Development commands

Run from the repo root:

| Command                             | What it does                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                          | Runs every package's `dev` (Expo + Worker) via Turborepo |
| `pnpm dev:app`                      | Expo dev server only (web on port 3000)                  |
| `pnpm dev:worker`                   | `wrangler dev` only (port 8787)                          |
| `pnpm build`                        | Build all packages                                       |
| `pnpm lint`                         | ESLint across the monorepo                               |
| `pnpm typecheck`                    | `tsc --noEmit` across the monorepo                       |
| `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check` | Prettier write / check                                   |
| `pnpm test`                         | Run all package test suites                              |

### Expo (apps/app)

```bash
pnpm dev:app          # then press w / i / a
```

Web: http://localhost:3000

### Worker (apps/worker)

```bash
pnpm dev:worker
curl http://localhost:8787/health
# { "status": "ok", "service": "pandam-api", ... }
```

### D1 / Drizzle (packages/database)

```bash
pnpm --filter @pandam/database generate       # schema -> SQL migration
pnpm --filter @pandam/database migrate:local  # apply migrations to local D1
pnpm --filter @pandam/database seed:local     # load the category seed
```

Then `pnpm dev:worker` and, for example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/v1/categories
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"a@example.com","password":"a decent pw 1","displayName":"A"}'
# → { ok:true, data:{ user, profile, token, expiresAt } } + Set-Cookie
```

The **D1 `DB` binding and the R2 `MEDIA` binding are both enabled** in
`apps/worker/wrangler.jsonc` with placeholder ids, so `wrangler dev --local`
runs both against local emulation — a SQLite file and a folder under
`apps/worker/.wrangler/` — **no cloud resource, no Cloudflare account needed**
for local development. Durable Objects and Queues bindings remain
declared-but-commented (realtime chat and background jobs aren't built yet);
provision each with `wrangler` and uncomment its block when needed. Nothing
here creates cloud resources or deploys. See
[`docs/architecture/domain.md`](docs/architecture/domain.md) and
[`docs/architecture/auth.md`](docs/architecture/auth.md).

`migrate:local` applies **every** migration under `packages/database/migrations`
in order — run it again any time you pull new migration files, it's a no-op
for ones already applied.

### Demo data

Two separate things are both called "demo" here, don't confuse them:

- **`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_DATA=1`** (in `apps/app/.env.local`) overlays a
  client-only showcase (fake ids like `demo-l-...`) on top of whatever the API
  actually returns. Fine for a quick visual look, but nothing in it is a real
  row — you can't send an offer on a `demo-` item, and real content merges in
  around it rather than being replaced.
- **`node scripts/seed-showcase.mjs [apiBaseUrl]`** creates that same showcase
  as REAL accounts, listings and requests through the live API (register,
  categories, listings, needs, image upload) — every item is a genuine
  server-side row, so the full request → offer → chat loop works on it. Run
  this against your local worker (`pnpm dev:worker` first) instead of turning
  on `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_DATA`, and leave that flag at `0`/unset. Idempotent —
  safe to re-run. Showcase accounts sign in with the password the script
  prints (`Showcase2026x` at the time of writing).

### Social sign-in (Google / Apple)

Optional. Without any of the below set, the app still runs fine and the
Google/Apple buttons on login/register show a clear "not configured" message
instead of failing silently. To turn them on you need your **own** Google
Cloud / Apple Developer credentials — nobody else's client ids will work for
your build:

- `apps/app/.env.local`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_WEB`,
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_NATIVE` — not secret, embedded in the bundle.
- `apps/worker/.dev.vars`: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_IDS` (comma-separated — every
  platform client id, since the server has to accept an ID token minted for
  any of them), `APPLE_OAUTH_AUDIENCES` (your bundle id, plus a Services ID
  if you also want Apple sign-in on web).
- Apple sign-in additionally needs a **custom EAS development build** — it's
  a native module Expo Go doesn't include, so it won't appear at all when
  testing through plain Expo Go on a phone. Google sign-in works in Expo Go.

See `apps/app/src/lib/auth/oauth.ts` and `apps/worker/src/lib/oauth.ts` for
exactly what each value verifies.

## Environment variables

Documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example) and
[`apps/worker/.dev.vars.example`](apps/worker/.dev.vars.example).
`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are embedded in the client bundle and are not secret
(`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` points the app at the Worker; `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_DATA`
toggles the client-only showcase overlay — see **Demo data** above). Worker
vars/secrets go in `apps/worker/.dev.vars` locally (gitignored) and
`wrangler secret put` in deployed environments. Auth needs **no secret
locally** — password and token hashing use the runtime's Web Crypto.
`CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) extends the credentialed-CORS allowlist beyond
the built-in `localhost` dev origins. Razorpay, Sentry, PostHog and Expo push
are all optional and degrade to a clear "not configured" state without keys.
No real secrets live in this repo.
