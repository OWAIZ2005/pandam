/**
 * Live checklist under the password field on sign-up.
 *
 * The rule is "10+ characters, with a letter and a number". Told only as an
 * error after submitting, that is a small puzzle; shown as a checklist that
 * ticks as you type, it is not a rule at all — you can see when you are done.
 * This is the cheapest possible version of "the error should explain how to
 * fix it": pre-empt the error entirely.
 *
 * It renders nothing until the field has been touched, so an untouched form
 * does not open with a list of things you have failed to do.
