/**
 * The one way the API tells a user something happened.
 *
 * `notify()` always writes the durable `notifications` row first, then tries
 * to deliver a push copy to that user's registered devices. The row is the
 * product's source of truth (the in-app feed reads it, and the unread badge
 * counts it); the push is best-effort and never allowed to fail the request
 * that caused it — a user whose phone is off must still see the offer when
 * they next open the app.
 *
 * Every route that used to call `repos.notifications.create` directly goes
 * through here instead, so copy and delivery stay in one place rather than
 * drifting per route.
