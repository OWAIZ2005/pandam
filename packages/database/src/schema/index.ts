/**
 * PANDAM database schema (Drizzle ORM, Cloudflare D1 / SQLite).
 *
 * One file per aggregate; this barrel re-exports every table, its row types and
 * its status/enum tuples. `createDb()` (see ../client.ts) binds the whole
 * schema so the Worker gets a fully typed client.
 *
 * Conventions (see ./_shared.ts and ../id.ts):
 *  - primary keys are application-generated prefixed strings (`usr_…`, `lst_…`)
 *  - timestamps are epoch milliseconds (`integer`); `created_at` defaults in
 *    SQL, `updated_at` is refreshed by the repository layer
 *  - status columns use `text` enums + CHECK constraints for integrity
 *  - foreign keys use ON DELETE cascade/restrict/set-null as documented per table
